<b><i>HRAS</i></b>(Hospital Record Access System) is a record management system (RMS)</br>
that complies with all HIPAA regulations, and allows for effective record retention,</br>
modification, and inventory management. This system stores medical records and</br>
hospital inventory status in a database and allows medical staff to upload files to</br>
the database and access these documents for modification according to their roles.</br>
Upon checkout, the system generates a bill based on the length of the patient's stay</br>
and the resources used in their treatment. The system is secured with a log on ser-<br>
vice that uses a username and password for individual staff member's account. The <br>
system also keeps logs of all access to documents within HRAS in order to track acco-<br>
untability of the hospital and medical staffs. This was a group project done for an<br>
imaginary client(GHSA) as a part of the Software Dev/Professional Practice course. It<br>
was written in C# and SQL.
